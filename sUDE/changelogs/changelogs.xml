			<blockquote>WHY VERSION 2.0 ?</blockquote>
			<p>
				Because it has some radical changes to the overall feeling of the gunplay, with many possible breaking
				changes.
				But no worries, the core principles of sGunplay are still the foundations of the mod!
			</p>

			<blockquote>SUMMARY OF THE CHANGES</blockquote>
			<p>
				- Overall <u>more responsive</u> aiming model <br />
				- Completely <u>new recoil</u> system <br />
				- with <u>working attachments</u>! <br />
				- Completely <u>new weapon inertia</u> system <br />
				- New accessibility settings, like FoV while ADS <br />
				- Improved dynamic crosshair <br />
				- with 6 new style <br />
				- Performances improvements and a ton of bug fixes
			</p>
		</preamble>
		<changes>
			<added>A completely new aiming model!</added>
			<added>Weapon handling will now feel much more responsive and less "sluggish"</added>
			<added>New recoil system</added>
			<added>
				Weapon attachments, such as buttstocks, handguards and compensators, will now contribute to the
				recoil control
			</added>
			<added>
				Recoil intensity will "accumulate" if you shoot faster than your ability to control the recoil and to
				reset the weapon.<br />
				While short burst are manegeable, being accurate with a long spray is not an easy task (especially at
				long engagements), but it will become easier once you reach the "apex" of the recoil. At that point,
				you'll be able to be more consistent in controlling it.
			</added>
			<added>Two new options to change FieldOfView while ADS</added>
			<added>Added 6 new dynamic crosshair styles</added>
			<added>You can now choose dynamic crosshair color via RGB format</added>
			<added>
				New stats meters are visible in the inventory UI; they will show an approximation of Inventory Weight
				and Shooting Accuracy
			</added>
			<added>Weapon retraction (when you hit a wall) has been improved for weapons with shorter barrels</added>
			<added>A very subtle vignette effect is being used when focusing</added>
			<added>New animations when interacting with the weapon (changing firemode or zeroing)</added>
			<added>New animation for the shake caused by Kuru illness</added>
			<added>New animation for the shake caused by cold</added>
			<added>New mod logo</added>
			<added>Recoil definition for SSG82</added>
			<added>PiP definition for SSG82 optic</added>
			<added>Kazuar (AK night vision optic) now behaves correctly and has proper PiP</added>
			<added>Starlight (M4 night vision optic) now behaves correctly and has proper PiP</added>
			<changed>Reduced head bobbing while AimingDownSight</changed>
			<changed>Faster and smoother misalignment overlay when using long range optics</changed>
			<changed>Decoupled long range optic behaviour from the misalignment overlay</changed>
			<changed>Improved PiP lens positioning; it will now sits better in the optic</changed>
			<changed>Improved PiP visibility for some optics</changed>
			<changed>The options menu have been remade from scratch, with improved performance and look</changed>
			<changed>Removed the default WeaponInteraction keybinding</changed>
			<changed>Deadzone is now marked as deprecated and planned for major changes or removal</changed>
			<fixed>
				Possibly definitive solution for the inventory weight desync, which caused the hand position being
				desynced between clients
			</fixed>
			<fixed>Dynamic Crosshairs were not perfectly centered, new ad-hoc crosshairs are now pixel perfect</fixed>
			<fixed>The correct NightVision type wasn't being used</fixed>
			<fixed>Wrong sway animation, and made it slightly slower</fixed>
			<fixed>Camera shake not being applied while AimingDownSight</fixed>
			<fixed>Recoil control function was not being applied properly</fixed>
			<fixed>Errors in stringtable.csv translation file</fixed>
			<fixed>Improved server-side performance by removing some unnecessary logic</fixed>
			<fixed>Missing preset definition for input actions</fixed>
			<fixed>ItemOptics config class definition for DayZ 1.19</fixed>
			<modding>New Ad-hoc config parameters for PiP</modding>

			<p>
				And here we are with the <b>2.0</b> update, which brings some breaking changes about PostProcessing
				effects, but for a greater good. For this reason (and lack of free time on my side), the <b>2.0</b>
				update has been sitting in the experimental version of sFramework for quite a while; apologies for the
				delay.
			</p>
			<p>
				With this update, sFramework removes its implementation of the <code>sPPEManager</code>, since vanilla
				DayZ added its own implementation (<code>PPEManager</code>).<br />
				That leads to the <code>sPPEffect</code> now extending the vanilla <code>PPERequester</code> class.
			</p>
			<b>But why all these breaking changes?</b>
			<p>
				Compatibility!<br />
				Previously, sFramework's PPEffect system was necessary since vanilla DayZ lacked one, and
				if two mods wanted to use ppeffects at the same time without sFramework, all bets were off!<br />
				With the <s>new</s> vanilla system (which all mods can and should use) it's much easier for mods to
				cooperate.<br />
				For this reason, sFramework now relies on it too to provide you the API for defining PPEffects, with the
				benefit of compatibility with any other mod, without the need to make <i>compatibility mods</i>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although the <s>new</s> vanilla system is pretty similar to my previous implementation, it comes with
				some differences, which means you may need to make some changes to your effects.
				To learn more about it, I highly suggest giving a read to the
				<a href="https://simonvic.github.io/sUDE/tutorials/1/">new sPPEffect tutorial</a>
